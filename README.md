## Project Objective
Create an interactive visual map of live earthquake data using [USGS GeoJSON Feeds](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). Earthquakes on the map are reflected by their magnitude (size of marker) and their depth (color of marker). Each earthquake instance on the map needs a corresponding popup to provide some additional information about the event. A legend should be provided to give context to the different colors.
